# Marcus Intalex Tribute page

## Why I chose the subject

I chose the subject  DJ Marcus Intalex because I am a fan of drum & bass music.  He was quite influential in many  of the tracks I listened to and Djed with, especially in the early 2000s. 

Whether they were tracks he made himself, with other artists, remixed or through his record label the tracks were always worth listening to or buying.

So when I heard of his death it made me listen back to a lot of tracks that I had enjoyed and it reminded me of an enjoyable time.


## What I learned from this project

Through doing the project it made me more aware of being careful with setting up my HTML so my CSS works correctly. I didn’t know about the target=” _blank”  attribute for opening a new page. My reflections are that using CSS well is harder than you think.
